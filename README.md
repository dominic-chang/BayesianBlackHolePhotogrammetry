This is the code for a study of a model that I made for time averaged images of accretion flows around black holes as applied to EHT 2017 data.
I showed that my model is able to place mass measurement constraints of EHT sources that is consistent with the EHT mass measurements and some of the existing stellar dynamics estimates.
